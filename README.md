# Closed-Loop-Simulation-CLS-C-Codes
This repository deals with Closed Loop Simulation functions which have been converted from Python to C++

INCONSISTENCIES and INCOMPLETIONS
The frames_cpp.h code is incomplete with respect to one function and another function has not been properly defined (hence it being commented out).
The constants_1U_cpp.h code does not define a few constants.
